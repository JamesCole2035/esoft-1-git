Текст песни When we were young (The logical song) (David Guetta)
Исполнители: David Guetta, Kim Petras.

When we were young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A colorful miracle
Remember how everything was so beautiful?

I miss the old days when the skies were blue
I miss the long nights stayin' up with you
I miss the summer 'cause we were in it together
I miss my hometown, don't you miss it too?
Drivin' to nowhere, nothin' else to do
I miss the old days, I wish they lasted forever

When we were young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A colorful miracle
Remember how everything was so beautiful?
Woah, when we were young, it seemed that life was so simple then
So innocent, infinite
Look at us now, is it so different, isn't it?

I miss the ocean, the hair across your face
The little moments before we moved away
And lookin' back now,
we shoulda stayed there forever
And now we're over the moon and we're under the stars
Know where we're been and we know who we are
And even the time goes by, I'll always remember

When we were young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A colorful miracle
Remember how everything was so beautiful?
Woah, when we were young, it seemed that life was so simple then
So innocent, infinite
Look at us now, it's so different, isn't it?
